### Setting the profile selected to the repo
---
Once you select a profile, the status bar text changes to selected profile name [1 in image below]. 

> The icon might display a "warning" sign if the current repo is not using the username and email selected.

If you want to apply the username and email defined in the selected profile to the current repository, click on profile name in the status bar (e.g `Work` ) and then select `Yes, apply` in the dialog [2 image below].
